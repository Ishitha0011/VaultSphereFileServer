# VaultSphereFileServer
Secure File Server with Flask Backend and React based frontend.

VaultSphere is a secure, privacy-focused platform designed for users who prioritize control over their data. This project allows individuals and organizations to safely upload, manage, and access files, offering enhanced security features, flexible deployment options, and privacy-centric design.

Key Features

Enhanced Data Privacy and Security:
VaultSphere employs robust encryption protocols, allowing users to secure their data from unauthorized access.
Unlike commercial storage solutions, VaultSphere does not track or analyze user data, giving users complete data sovereignty.

Decentralization-Friendly Design:
VaultSphere supports decentralized storage architectures, enabling users to move beyond the vulnerabilities associated with centralized systems. This architecture empowers users with more control over data redundancy and availability.

Customizable Access Controls:
With advanced access management options, VaultSphere lets users assign viewing or modification permissions for each file or folder. Authentication is managed using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring only authorized users gain access to sensitive data.

Secure File Type Restrictions:
VaultSphere enforces restrictions on uploadable file types (such as .txt, .csv, .pdf, etc.), reducing the risk of handling potentially harmful files. This layer of security makes it a reliable choice for handling sensitive information.

Open-Source Flexibility:
Being open-source, VaultSphere allows developers to modify and adapt the platform to meet specific security and usability needs. Users can inspect the code and customize both frontend and backend functionalities, making it highly adaptable for various use cases.

Flexible Deployment Options:
VaultSphere can be deployed locally or within private servers, providing a level of control often unavailable with standard cloud storage solutions. This flexibility makes it ideal for those who require secure, self-hosted environments.
